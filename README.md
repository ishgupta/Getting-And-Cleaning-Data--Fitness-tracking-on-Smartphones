The data set for this experiment located at UCI Machine Learning is available at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The run_analysis.R file fetches the data (after it is downloaded to disk), reads it and merges different data sets together to combine the information of the Activities, and Subjects along with the data collected from Experiments. This helps in understanding which Subject had done what kind of physical activity as per the type of Activity(Standing, Walking etc.)

CodeBook gives a very brief description about the experiment done, and the details of what the data set would include.

Data set is also attached along with the repository for all the files referred for this Exercise.
